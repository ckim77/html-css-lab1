        <h2>Daily LakerLight: Lakers' first win of the season!</h2>

        <p>Lebron scores 19 points with 4 three-pointers as his hot 3-point shooting continues.
            Russell Westbrook came to life as he handed out 13 assists.  However, the highlight of the night was Carmelo Anthony, as he dropped 28 points to guide the Lakers past the Grizzlies and Ja Morant,
            who doubled-doubled with 40 points and 10 assists on the night.  Is Lebron at the cusp of another MVP season? And is Ja Morant becoming a superstar in his 3rd season?

        <p>Carmelo Anthony pours in 28 points as he was a scorching 66% from the field.  His 6 three-pointers were crucial in the Lakers maintaining their lead against the Grizzlies, and his final free
            throws in the last seconds of regulation helped ice the game.  With Russell and Anthony Davis inevitably cloggin up the paint with their lack of shooting, Carmelo's catch-and-shoot talents
            have really helped to alleviate the lack of three-point shooting the Lakers sorely needed for the Lebron era.  Since Carmelo has always been proficient at the catch-and-shoot role, Lakers fans 
            are excited to see how this new edge to the offense could unlock more of the big 3's potential.

            Talent Horton-Tucker and Kendrick Nunn have been nursing their own injuries but are near a return to the court.  With the Lakers lacking much backcourt depth, will THT and Nunn provide the 
            necessary spark? Lakers fans are excited to see how the addition of more three-point shooting and increased energy in perimeter defense could aid the Lakers to return to the lofty heights of 
            NBA championships.
